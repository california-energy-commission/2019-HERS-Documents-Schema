# CONTRIBUTING

The [README](README.md) and this contributing guide are both written in 
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) which is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling 
all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

Discussion about code base improvements happens in GitHub issues and on pull requests.

## Contributor Workflow

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

- Fork repository
- Create topic branch
- Commit patches
- Push changes to your fork
- Create pull request

If a commit references an issue, please add the reference. 
For example: `refs #321` or `fixes #12`. Using the `fixes` or `closes` keywords will cause the applicable issue to be closed when the pull request is merged.
