# CONTRIBUTING

Discussion about code base improvements happens in GitHub issues and on pull requests.

## Contributor Workflow

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

- Fork repository
- Create topic branch
- Commit patches
- Push changes to your fork
- Create pull request

If a commit references an issue, please add the reference. 
For example: `refs #321` or `fixes #12`. Using the `fixes` or `closes` keywords will cause the applicable issue to be closed when the pull request is merged.

Refer to the [Git manual](https://git-scm.com/doc) for more information about Git and download

## "Decision Making" Process

The project merge maintainers and ultimately the project lead are responsible for deciding whether
a pull request is merged.
